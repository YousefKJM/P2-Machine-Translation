# P2-Machine-Translation
Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.  In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.
